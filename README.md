# DeepRL_CabDriverProfitOptimization
SuperCabs, a leading app-based cab provider is looking for retention of good cab drivers in a large Indian metro city. In this highly competitive travel industry, retention of good cab drivers is a crucial business driver.  Most drivers get a healthy number of ride requests from customers throughout the day. But with the recent hikes in electricity prices (all cabs are electric), many drivers complain that although their revenues are gradually increasing, their profits are almost flat. Thus, it is important that drivers choose the 'right' rides, i.e. choose the rides which are likely to maximize the total profit earned by the driver that day.
